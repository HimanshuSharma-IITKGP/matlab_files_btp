First do all the calculation in tensor form on paper, using books and research papers.
Then use MATLAB to generate component wise equations.
Do the non-dimensionalisation on paper again.
Then use MATALB to generate those component wise equations.
Export .tex files from MATLAB containing the equations.
convert that raw .tex so that it includes new macro definitions. This makes the LaTeX look more elegant.

steps 5 and 6 can be combined to make one single function to do that.
